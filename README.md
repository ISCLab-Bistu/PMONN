# PMONN
We propose a new optoelectronic neural network called the Phase of Microring-based Optoelectronic Neural Network (PMONN), specifically designed for the microring resonator (MRR) system.   The PMONN network's core architecture is the Convolutions and Batch Normalization (CB) unit, which primarily comprises three layers: a phase-based (PB) convolutional layer, a Depth-Point-Wise (DPW) convolutional layer, and a reconstructed Batch Normalization (RBN) layer. The PB convolution kernel proposed uses modulable phase shifts of the add-drop MRRs as learnable parameters and the optical transfer function of the add-drop MRRs as convolution weights. The DPW convolution kernel offered amplifies the weights of the PB convolution kernel by taking the amplification factors as convolution weights. Additionally, the DPW convolution kernel is implemented by the trans-impedance amplifiers (TIAs) in the MRR system. To tackle the internal covariate shift problem while training the optoelectronic neural network, the RBN layer is proposed, normalizing the DPW convolutional layer's outputs by reconstructing the BN layer of the electronic neural network. We use differential amplifiers (DAs) in the MRR system to implement the RBN layer.  This work offers a way to implement the basic components of photoelectric neural networks using the MRR system. Furthermore, the PMONN can potentially be utilized as the backbone of the future photoelectric object detection neural network.
